### Javascript Book, Chapter 10

- The order of execution is not linear in javascript
- Global, function, eval context
- Global or function-level scope
- The Stack: javascript processes one line of code at a time
- Execution context, order doesn't matter as much as the context of the functions
- Ideally, create variables inside the functions that use them
- The computer will go through the stack looking for error handling code before it throws and error
- Debug workflow:
- Where is the problem?
- What exactly is the problem?
- Write code directly to browser to check for errors
- /console-log.html
- Do not leave console.log in your script for a live site
- Do we use all of these other console methods or is console.log just the most useful?
- Breakpoints pause the execution of a script
- Try, catch, finally
- throw new Error()
