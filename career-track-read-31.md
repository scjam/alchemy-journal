### React Custom Hooks
- A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks
- Custom Hooks are a convention that naturally follows from the design of Hooks, rather than a React feature
- Have to start with use
- Two components sharing the same Hook do not share state
- Why do we capitalize Hook everywhere?
- Hooks are functions to pass information between

### Hook Rules
- Only call hooks at the top level (no loops, nests, etc)
- Only call hooks from react functions
```
eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```
- React relies on the order in which Hooks are called

- Bookmarked the last two articles for reference later!
