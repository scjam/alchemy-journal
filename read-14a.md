### CSS Transitions & Animations Article

- An element must have a change in state for a transition to take place. i.e. :hover, :focus, etc
- Four transition properties: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay
- Not all properties may be transitioned
- We worked with these for a bit in rock-paper-scissors!
- I skimmed through this but honestly I feel like this article would be more useful in reference when you're actually trying to work on something, not hypothetically
- Simple transitions: fade in, change color, grow & shrink, rotate, square to circle, swing, inset border
- Animated buttons
- Ok I love the CSS pure bounce animation, the other ones were meh
