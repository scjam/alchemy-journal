###SQL
- SELECT statements aka queries
- * for all
- selecting simpler versions of the table
- A more specific filter is WHERE, use for numbers and strings with conditions
- DISTINCT discards duplicates
- ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, etc
- Database schema is what describes the structure of each table
- INSERT to add new data
- UPDATE to edit existing data
- Take extra care with DELETE as its very easy to delete data permanently
- CREATE TABLE (like what we did today) makes a new table
- DROP TABLE is just bigger delete
