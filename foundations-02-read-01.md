### JS Templates

- Template literals: backticks, can contain placeholders, can be tagged, multi-line strings
- I feel like we've already been using string substitution, but not multiline strings
- People were really hyped on temperate literals when they came out...

### Array Methods

- A callback is a function to execute on each element
- forEach() executes the callback once for each array element. forEach() does not mutate the array, always returns undefined
- Callback not invoked for missing values
- for loop ~= forEach
- forEach must be called on an Array, simpler version of a for loop
- Callback function accepts three arguments: element value, element index, array being traversed (uncommon)
