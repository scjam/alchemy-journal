### Chart.js documentation

- Skimmed through some of the docs and started using during lab time today. Will finish reading and use more tomorrow when I work more with my chart.

### Canvas API

- Canvas can be styled like an img
- Provide fallback content for older browsers
- getContext() i.e. 2d
- quadrant 4 on a grid
- Canvas supports rectangles and paths
- (x, y, width, height)
- Drawing paths with coordinates
- lines, arcs, curves, moving the pen
- To add color to shape: fillStyle = and strokeStyle =
- Ok wow, for loops and color palettes, I'm in love
- math plus rgba or linewidth = fun!
- I like all this detail but something tells me there has to be other apps like chart.js to help do the drawing for you?
- This seemed the most feasible: using an existing image to create a pattern with canvas
- Even cooler...I can use Canvas to alter fonts? Now this, I would use.
- textBaseline lets you decrease or increase the baseline (great for dramatic script/italic font)
