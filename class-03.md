- Ordered lists are numbered, unordered lists are bullets

- Adding a scroll can help prevent messy-looking overflow content
- Border > Margin > Padding (p. 307-308)

### JS Book Review of Chapter 2 & Chapter 4
- Arrays are a type of variable that stores lists of values instead of a single value
- Array literal = technique for creating an array
- Array constructor = Array()
- The index of an array starts with 0, and is the automatically given number of that particular item
- You can change/remove/add single items in an array
- if...else statements, aka what the r-p-s lab is all about, helpful to think of like a choose your own adventure novel
- Switch statements start with a variable and are then followed by cases that indicate a possible value for that variable
- ...I feel like I'm still not 100% on board with what truthy/falsey actually means
- Logical operators are processed left to right
- Loops: For, While, Do While
- For loops are if you need to run code a specific number of times (most common)
- While loops are for when you don't know how many times to run the code
- Do while loops run statements inside curly brackets at least once
