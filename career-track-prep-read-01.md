### Quanitity Always Trumps Quality
I definitely agree with the writer about coding being a craft, with most crafts like woodworking or masonry, it's the doing of the thing that makes you better at it. Just reading or talking or brainstorming about it doesn't make you better at doing the thing. Even when you're not doing it 100% correctly, you learning more by going through the motions than you would if you waited until you could do it 100% correctly the first time.

### Clean Code: Chapter 1
- We definitely discussed this one day in foundations. If humans invented computers, why didn't we invent them to speak a language we understand better? But that's why there will most likely always be a need for coders, because we will never be able to do that very thing.
- "...deciding that a working mess is better than nothing." p.3
- Bad code is a vicious cycle of decreased productivity and increased mess
- I wonder what percentage of software developers would say they believe in clean code and yet still write messy code?
- Broken Windows Theory applies to code as well as urban planning
- Don't be afraid to rename to make it cleaner
"It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple!" p.12
- What is clean code?
  - Clean code is elegant and efficient
  - Clean code is simple and direct and readable
  - Clean code can be read and enhanced by someone other than the original author
  - Clean code is code that has been taken care of
  - TDD
  - Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple abstractions
  - Each line you read is what you expect
- Summary: Clean code is a practice that is not easier to write than bad code, but will make your life and other developers' lives a lot more efficient.

### TDD red-green-refactor
- Write a test that states what you want to accomplish, write the code to make that test pass, after you're in the green you can refactor to further optimize your code

### Cycles of TDD
- a) The Three Laws of TDD, b) red-green-refactor, c) The Specific/Generic Cycle, d) Clean Architecture
- TDD is about repeating cycles and not jumping too far ahead that your code no longer makes sense, by following these steps you will be forced into clean code.
