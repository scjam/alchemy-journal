###Problem Solving
- Fix something that is broken or build something
- I thought I was a good problem solver...until a few weeks ago
- Be Open Minded, Inquisitive, Ask the Right Questions, Slow Down, Don't be lazy, Don't Panic
- Solve the actual problem, not a symptom of the problem
- Function over purpose
- Multiple ways to solve the same problem
- Checking for typos and other small mistakes (!!!)
- 1. Question assumptions 2. Reason through logic 3. Diversify thought
- Ask questions!! Be a good listener and listen to what others have to say
- Follow up questions mean you're actually paying attention
- Not every question has to have a definitive answer, leave some open-eneded
- Tough questions can build a relationship faster
- Check tone and group dynamics
