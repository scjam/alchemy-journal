### Clean Code
- Since we already read chapter 1, I looked around and found someone else's notes on chapter 2
- Names should be self-explanatory
- Class names should be nouns but not that imply action
- Verbs go with method names
- Add meaningful context
- Can someone search for the names and do they make sense?
- Not a time to be funny
- Too much context is unnecessary
- Keep your reader in mind

### Class Syntax
- Class is a kind of function
- Apparently its not just syntactic sugar but actually introduces something new!
- Ok I read the whole article but this feels like one of those things that unless I'm using it, I'm not retaining the info or it doesn't stick. Can't wait to put it to use because it's seems incredibly helpful!

### MDN - Classes
- Classes are a template for creating objects
- Special functions with class expressions and class declarations
- class Keyword {}
- Must declare a class to access it, not hoisted
- let Keyword = class {}
- I remember using static for the code challenge prep
- Also remember using extends
