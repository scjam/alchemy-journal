###Diversity & Inclusion
- One of the reasons I chose to do Alchemy, get into tech, get in the squish is because of articles like this. In most industries, the managers, directors, boards, etc are predominantly male. I want to be a part of breaking that glass ceiling.
- In the mid-80s we almost reached a 40% female CS degree rate 
- Male-centric gaming culture definitely holds true. We never had a console or gameboys growing up, none of the games ever appealed to me or my sisters save for Mario which was less gender-specific (but hello no one ever wants to be Peach, she wears pink and doesn't have a lot going on)
- Chicken-and-egg metaphor; games were only marketed to boys and boys were the only ones buying games
- Definitely feel this...I was always good at math and science up until high school and then wasn't "good enough" to do any of it in college
- My first "professional" job had a Women's Partner Network that fostered mentorships, provided an outlet for the women at work to talk about furthering their careers and problems that we had encountered. It was life-changing. One of my goals if I worked at a company that lacked a "diversity partner network" would be to start one.
- (Ok, was USA Today fake news in 2015? Or still real?)
