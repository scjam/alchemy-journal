###Node.js
- Stack Overflow: "Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library."
- V8 is Google's open-source JavaScript engine
- npm is a package manager bundled with Node
- Use a version manager over the official download
- I'm making an assumption that node is how the previous cohort built a game within the terminal?
- npm is the world's largest software registry
- Using React requires a working knowledge of node
- Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server
- Node is single-threaded and event-driven
- Can handle large numbers of connections simultaneously
- Request & response
- Best for building apps with real-time interaction
- Node is "bare-bones"
- "Easily share code between the server and the client"
- Node speaks JSON
