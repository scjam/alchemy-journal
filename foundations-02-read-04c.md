###Asynchronous JavaScript, Promises, and fetch
- It's an illusion (Michael) that computers run programs simultaneously
- A function that is called when an event is triggered is a callback
- A promise will start in a pending state
- Either returns in a resolved state or a rejected state
- Many Web API features now use asynchronous code to run
- I'm just going to revisit promises this weekend...
- fetch() provides an easy way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network
- Creates a promise that resolves with a response object
- Only way to get the data is via a response method
