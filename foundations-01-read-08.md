- Finally googled what foo/bar means
- clear() to remove all keys and values
- "Storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeITEM(), or clear() is called and actually changes something"
- Why do I feel like we're one day behind on readings? I could have definitely used this knowledge today!
- 5 megabytes, QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR, no
