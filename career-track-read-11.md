### Web Scraping with JS and NodeJS
- NodeJS is a JS runtime which allows JS to run server-side
- We already use HTTP clients like superagent
- Easiest way to get started web scraping is with regex
- JSDOM creates a DOM out of an HTML string

- Hello MDN, my old friend...
- querySelector() returns the first Element within the document that matches a selector, otherwise null
- Use backslash escaping and watch syntax

### MDN - querySelectorAll()
- returns a NodeList of a documents elements that match the group of selectors
