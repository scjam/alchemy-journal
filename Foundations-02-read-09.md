###SQL Relations and Joins
- I loooove working with data, these SQL table lessons are great
- Normalization is storing data across multiple tables
- Minimizes duplication and allows data to grow independently
- Joining the data of two tables with INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
- IS NULL or IS NOT NULL
- Without normalization, inconsistencies can occur
- Bookmarked that SQL JOINs page
