## Atomic Design

- Atomic Design in a way reminds me of systems theory in sociology, no one thing is independent of it's environment or influences of the things around it.
- Organisms are large sections that we can easily extract
- Molecules can be extracted from organisms and usually repeated in several places
- Atoms are basic HTML elements (can't be broken down any further)
- Consistent folder structure/pattern
- When breaking down design elements, you start big and go small. When building with code, start small and then use them to compose the bigger components
- Atomic design reduces duplication in styling work and CSS
- Research before diving into a project
- Breaking down UI features into re-usable composable components

## Thinking in React

1. Start with a mock, and break the UI into a component hierarchy
2. Build a static version with react
3. Identify the minimal representation of UI state
4. Identify where state should live
5. Add Inverse Data Flow

## Callbacks

- A call back is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing
- Javascript will not wait for a response before moving on to the next function
- Still not clear on callbacks...
- Bookmarked the first class functions article because it seems like a useful reference
- So a callback is both invoked and returned in the same function...?

## Classes

- constructor() method is called automagically
- Class can be considered "syntactic sugar"
- Classes may include getters and setters
- Data object: an object containing only data and no functions
- Simple syntax to declare and extend a class
- We can use function to declare class
