### Destructuring
- Like refactoring for a function
- "Parentheses are required when using object literal destructuring assignment without a declaration"
- Pretty abstract until I got to the part about nested objects and array destructuring...definitely understand where it can be helpful especially with large objects

### Spread
- Rest syntax condenses and spread syntax expands
- Spread can replace push, splice, concat, etc.
- Simple merging of objects? Mind blown

### Rest
- function f(a, b, ...theArgs) { // ... }
- Only one rest param and it must be the last argument
