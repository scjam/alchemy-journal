###Styling HTML5 Forms
- Atom text editor
- For on label matches id on input for radio buttons
- Fieldset is a border with an inset <legend>
- I don't use letter-spacing enough
- Hide generic buttons and add custom imagery
- cursor: pointer
- Also need to set things when checked or clicked
- Checkboxes and radio buttons can be similarily styled
- display: block for inputs will set them on different lines
- webkit
- This tutorial dude is using a lot of px rather than %?
