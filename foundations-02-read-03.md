### CSS Grid Garden

- Ah yes, shouldn't we design for mobile viewing first, and then desktop?
- Responsive reacts quickly and positively to change, adaptive means to modify behavior for new situations
- Design that adapts to different screen sizes and browsers
- Is there anything worse than being on a mobile site with limited abilities and not being able to just stay on a regular site? I hate that
- Very interested in using this viewpoint lengths CSS...but math
- I literally said this above...mobile first approach!
- Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the page
- Float values: both, left, right, none, inherit
- I need to revisit this grid article when I'm building a grid in CSS
- I like the escalator analogy: things can be static and other items will flow around them
